# Hello, friend!

The purpose of this challenge is to confirm that you understand the process for developing, testing
and submitting your Python code.

Write and submit an *interactive* Python program that asks for the user's name and age, then prints how much older Python is than the user (based on a simple comparison of birth year). Python's first public release occurred in 1991. 
Something like this:

'''
Please tell me your name: Guido
Please tell me your age: 16
Hello, Guido. Python is 8 years older than you are!
'''
